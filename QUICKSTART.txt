This program saves movies as mp4 files. This executable can only be run through a terminal on a windows machine. The syntax is as follows:

m3u8Downloader.exe (--file | --movie) [--out]

The --file flag lets you input a text file with movie names per line to save multiple movies. Note that the --file or --movie flag is mandatory. The --movie flag lets you save a single movie. If the name contains more than 1 word, you will need to surround the name in quotes. The --out flag is optional and lets you specify a directory to save the mp4 files to. Default is "./Output". The directory can be absolute or local.


** Please make sure the movie name is correct **
