This command line program saves movies as mp4 files. This executable can only be run through a terminal on a Windows machine.
The syntax is as follows:

m3u8Downloader.exe [-t TXT | -f FILM] [-u] [-o OUT] [-r RES] [-y YEAR]

The --txt flag lets you input a text file with film names per line to save multiple films. Note that the --file or --movie flag is mandatory.
The --film flag lets you save a single film. If the name contains more than 1 word, you will need to surround the name in quotes.
The --out flag is optional and lets you specify a directory to save the mp4 files to. Default is "./Output". The directory can be absolute or local.
The --res flag lets you set the desired resolution, either 360, 720, or 1080. Note some old films don't have 1080p.
The --year flag lets you specify a movie production date in case there are 2 films with the same name.
The --update flag lets you update the movie registry with more modern films.
