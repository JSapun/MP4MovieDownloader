This command line program saves movies as mp4 files. This executable can only be run through a terminal on a Windows machine.
The syntax is as follows:

m3u8Downloader.exe [-t TXT | -f FILM] [-u] [-o OUT] [-r RES] [-y YEAR]

The --txt flag lets you input a text file with film names per line to save multiple films. Note that the --file or --movie flag is mandatory.
The --film flag lets you save a single film. If the name contains more than 1 word, you will need to surround the name in quotes.
The --out flag is optional and lets you specify a directory to save the mp4 files to. Default is "./Output". The directory can be absolute or local.
The --res flag lets you set the desired resolution, either 360, 720, or 1080. Note some old films don't have 1080p so default is 720p.
The --year flag lets you specify a movie production date in case there are 2 films with the same name.
The --update flag lets you update the movie registry with more modern films.


** Please make sure the movie name is correct. If the movie name contains any special characters (including apostrophe),
please replace with space. Captions are not supported at this time **


For text file formatting, one film is listed per line. If the film is a show, please specify include the word season and season number after the film
title. To specify the year, enter the film name followed by a comma followed by the year. Currently, text file input does not support resolution input.


Notes:
    * Due to network errors, some films can only be saved in 720p even if 1080p is offered.
    * Due to more network errors, it's possible some films will fail to save, try again at a later time.
    * This program does not work on MAC or linux! (you can try running this program using WINE)

Upcoming features:
    * Caption flag
    * Executable for MAC
    * Resolution input for text files
